## My Lists

**My Lists** include all the custom lists you’ve created or generated through tools like the Campaign Generator. These are fully editable and tailored to your specific needs.

**Use cases include:**
- Grouping contacts by category (e.g., *US EDM Blogs*, *Spotify Curators*, *French Radio Stations*)
- Saving lists for upcoming releases or ongoing campaigns
- Managing outreach for different regions, genres, or media types

You can add contacts to a list manually or directly from a search result. Think of *My Lists* as your personal contact collections, always ready for action.

**Features:**
- Rename, duplicate, or delete lists anytime
- Export contacts from any list for offline use
- Share lists with your team for collaborative campaigns

## Favorite Lists

If you're working with certain lists frequently, mark them as **Favorites** to pin them for easy access. Your favorite lists will always appear at the top of your dashboard under the Favorites tab.

**Why use Favorites:**
- Speed up repetitive tasks like pitching press or influencers
- Keep your most successful or high-value lists close
- Organize your workflow by priority

To favorite a list, just click the icon next to its name in *[My Lists](https://app.virtualpublicist.ai/contact-lists)*.  
You can unfavorite a list at any time without deleting it.

## Suggested Lists

**Suggested Lists** are AI-curated contact groups tailored to your genre, goals, campaign history, and industry trends. These lists are a powerful starting point for artists who want to expand their reach or explore new opportunities.

**What Suggested Lists can include:**
- Playlist curators relevant to your genre
- Blogs that featured artists similar to you
- Radio stations supporting similar releases
- Influencers engaging with music like yours

These are updated regularly and personalized based on:
- The music you’ve added to your profile
- Campaign performance metrics
- Trends within your music category or region
