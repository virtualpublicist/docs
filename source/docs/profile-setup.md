1. **Sign up and log in** to your Virtual Publicist account.
2. **Upload your profile photo**: Use a high-quality, recognizable image.
3. **Add your bio in the About section**: Keep it concise yet engaging, highlighting key achievements.
4. **Add your Spotify link**.
5. **Choose tags and genres**: Select the most relevant options to help contacts understand your music style.
6. **Add city and country**: Select the area where you live now.
7. **If you are a digital nomad**, indicate the location of your other social profiles to match them to your Virtual Publicist account. This location information will help those who want to collaborate with you or meet you.

## Tips for a Standout Profile
- Use professional language and focus on your advantages (what you can offer that others donâ€™t).
- Regularly update your profile with new releases and/or achievements.
- Ensure consistency across all platforms.
